# Guessing Game
an html webpage with a built-in guessing game with score tallying. Built as an assignment for Alchemy Code Lab Boot Camp Week 2.

The most recent update separates the CSS and JavaScript to their own files. Additionally it removes the alerts and prompts from the game, keeping all content on the page. Additional CSS and images have been included.

#### Instructions:
open the index.html file in the web browser of your choice. Read the introductory paragraphs about yours truly, then answer the four questions by filling out the corresponding field and pressing "Submit". After answering all four questions, the final "how did I do?" button will tell the user their score.
