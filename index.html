        <h2>Oh, hello.</h2>
        <p>My name is Jon.</p>

        <p>I was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. I've lived in Portland for eight years (next month!) I live with my wife, three cats, and nearly eight dozen plants. I love backpacking and mountain climbing, as well as listening to records while I cook.</p>

        <p>Much of my professional experience is in the service industry (see education experience). I worked my way through high school and college scooping popcorn, waiting tables, and making coffee. For the last half-dozen years I've shoehorned my way into doing customer service and light tech support (<i>have</i> you tried turning it off and back on again?) for various software companies and tech startups. I have experience in the tech industry, just not in the tech itself!</p>

        <p>After high school, I studied film production in Orange County. My film career peaked when I served Kevin Bacon coffee, and so I sought opportunities in other cities to serve coffee (see professional experience). Now that I know all there is to know about coffee, I'm excited to learn a thing or two about computer machines.</p>

        <p>I'm hoping to learn about coding and web development over the next few weeks. My immediate goal is to challenge myself as much as possible, while a less immediate goal is to change my career. Looking super-duper-long-term, I hope to one day live somewhere out where you can see all the stars at night, though I don't know how many years I could stand being outside walking distance of a bookstore.</p>
