        <h2>Oh, hello.</h2>
        <p>My name is Jon.</p>

        <p>I was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. I've lived in Portland for eight years (next month!) I live with my wife, three cats, and nearly eight dozen plants. I love backpacking and mountain climbing, as well as listening to records while I cook.</p>

        <p>Much of my professional experience is in the service industry (see education experience). I worked my way through high school and college scooping popcorn, waiting tables, and making coffee. For the last half-dozen years I've shoehorned my way into doing customer service and light tech support (<i>have</i> you tried turning it off and back on again?) for various software companies and tech startups. I have experience in the tech industry, just not in the tech itself!</p>

        <p>After high school, I studied film production in Orange County. My film career peaked when I served Kevin Bacon coffee, and so I sought opportunities in other cities to serve coffee (see professional experience). Now that I know all there is to know about coffee, I'm excited to learn a thing or two about computer machines.</p>

        <p>I'm hoping to learn about coding and web development over the next few weeks. My immediate goal is to challenge myself as much as possible, while a less immediate goal is to change my career. Looking super-duper-long-term, I hope to one day live somewhere out where you can see all the stars at night, though I don't know how many years I could stand being outside walking distance of a bookstore.</p>

        <p>Got that?</p>

        <!-- I need to update this section with buttons which call the allQuestion() function with the question number and correct value as objects. -->
        <!-- I need to update this section with html elements with Ids which will update the page if the answer is correct/wrong/invalid -->

        <p>Good! Let's test your reading comprehension with a little quiz.</p>

  //developing a new function for asking questions, so each button can simply call allQuestion() and receive an answer that can recognize a true response versus a false response, and parse it accurately depending on the correct answer, or re-run the question should the user submit an invalid response
  // this new function will also need to be able to mark off which question has been answered and tally the number of correct answers.
  // how about this: function that will reply to a true or false; it branches into two mini functions, which inversely operate based on the object in parenthesis, if (true) or if (false), then does an if/then for blank answer -> true answer -> false answer.
  // a correct response will give an affirmative and run the answer tally function, an incorrect will give a negative and run teh answer tally function
